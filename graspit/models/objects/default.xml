<!-- This file is used as boilerplate for loading geometry files
     that do not have an XML file. You can put any default parameters
     you want in here (except for link to the geometry file, which 
     gets filled in at runtime.
     
     Remember that for any properties for which you do not put a default
     value here, GraspIt wil lprobably use some default value that's
     hard-coded in the file loader.
